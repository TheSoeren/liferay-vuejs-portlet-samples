# Liferay Vue.js Portlet Samples
This repository contains Vue.js Portlet Samples for Liferay >= 7.2. 

## Why?
I created this repository because the Vue.js Portlet Generator 
<a href="https://github.com/liferay/liferay-js-toolkit/tree/master/packages/generator-liferay-js">liferay-js-generator</a> 
isn't up to date and requires multiple steps till the portlet is really usable.

I created a <a href="https://github.com/liferay/liferay-js-toolkit/issues/637">ticket</a> in that repository which 
describes this issue.

## How to use
Have a look in the portlet specific README.md files to see, what you have to do to get the portlets working.
